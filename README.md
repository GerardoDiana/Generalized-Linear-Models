[Write-Up](https://github.com/GerardoDiana/Generalized-Linear-Models/blob/master/HW2/DG_GLM_HW2_WRITEUP.pdf) description: 
- Derived the deviance from a poisson glm
- Expressed the gamma distribution as a member of the exponential dispersion family. Derived deviance from a gamma glm
- Model Implementation of Poisson GLM and Quasi Poisson GLM on the frabic dataset.
- Built a Poisson GLM to study the effect of the covariates (jet fuel concentration and organism strain) on the number of Ceriodaphnia organisms
